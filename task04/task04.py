# Task 04
#
# Write a python CLI which receives a year number as input and responds with the following information:

# - If the year is in the past, present or future
# - If the year is a leap year
# - If any of the permutations of its digits is a leap year. E.g.: 1975 -> 1957 -> 5971, etc.

# In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years:
# - The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
# - The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
# - The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.

# E.g., 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are NOT leap years.
